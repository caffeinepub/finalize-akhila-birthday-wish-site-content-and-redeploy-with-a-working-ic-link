2. Update the "Current Deployment" section above with:
   - The complete URL
   - The deployment timestamp
   - The canister ID
   - Verification status (e.g., "✅ All checks passed" or "⏳ Pending verification")
3. Verify the URL is different from any previous deployments (e.g., NOT `https://caffeine.supply/d/3`)
4. Test the URL in a fresh browser session before sharing
5. Complete all verification steps from `DEPLOYMENT.md`
